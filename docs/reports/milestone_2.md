# Boros Catalyst Milestone 2: Test Report

This document outlines the detailed analysis of the tests conducted on the **Fanout Mechanism** component of the Boros project. Each test case is thoroughly examined, covering the objectives, execution details, and expected outcomes. Please refer to the attached screenshots for detailed evidence.

### 1. Transaction Propagation

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that the fanout mechanism propagates transactions to peers successfully.

**Details:**
- Peers are provided via configuration and are initialized.
- The `Fanout Stage` periodically schedules a `transaction submission` task. This process ensures that the system keeps listening for incoming transactions to properly propagate them.
- The connected peers will concurrently wait for the server's next request.
- When a transaction is submitted, it will be propagated each to the connected peers.
- The logs below show the propagation process, where transactions are processed first, followed by acknowledgment upon successful transmission.

### 2. Multi-Peer Connectivity

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that the fanout mechanism connects to multiple peers simultaneously using node-to-node protocols.

**Details:**
- At the start, the `PeerManager` is initialized with a predefined set of peer addresses provided via configuration.
- The `PeerManager` creates a connection to each of these peers asynchronously, ensuring the system can manage multiple connections at once.
- Peer discovery via `peersharing mini-protocol` is also checked for every connected peer, ensuring a dynamic way of maintaining multiple concurrent connectivity.

### 3. Static Topology Configuration

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that a static topology can be provided via configuration and is honored by the fanout mechanism.

**Details:**
- A static list of peer addresses is provided in the configuration file and loaded at bootstrap.
- The `PeerManager` is initialized with these addresses, ensuring that only these specified peers are used for communication initially.
- The `PeerManager` verifies that the specified peers are available and initializes them accordingly.
- The peer connections are logged for debugging and traceability.

### 4. Dynamic Topology via On-Chain Relay Data

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that a dynamic topology can be constructed automatically using on-chain relay data from pool certificates.

**Details:**
- The fanout stage `Worker` fetches relay data using `relay_adapter.get_relays()` method of a generic RelayDataAdapater trait, to gather on-chain relay information that can be used for peer discovery and network topology creation.
- The `Worker` uses the fetched relay data to dynamically add new peers to the system. It selects `random relay data` from the pool and attempts to connect to those peers.
- The system checks whether the topology updates correctly by adding peers based on the dynamically retrieved on-chain relay data.
- If new peers are found, they are added to the current connected peers.

### 5. Dynamic Topology via Peer Sharing

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that a dynamic topology can be constructed via p2p networking using the peer sharing mini-protocol.

**Details:**
- The `Fanout Stage` periodically schedules a peer discovery task. This process ensures that the system keeps discovering new peers over time to expand the network.
- During operation, a `randomly chosen connected peer with peersharing enabled` performs peer discovery. This peer will have its own discovered peers, and one of these discovered peers will be chosen `randomly` and will be used to try for connection.
- A configuration to limit connected peers is also provided. If the total connected peers exceeds this limit, the `WorkerSchedule` will idle.
- If a peer discovery fails or a peer cannot be reached, the system logs the failure and retries the discovery process, demonstrating resilience in the network discovery process.
- The discovery and connection processes are logged, allowing for easy monitoring of the system’s dynamic topology construction.
- The logs also capture the errors encountered during the discovery process and provide insights into the system’s retry behavior.

# Docker

Boros provides already built public Docker image through Github Package. To execute Boros via Docker, use the following command:

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/txpipe/boros:latest
```

## Configuration

The default configuration file for Boros is located in `/etc/boros/config.toml` or the env `BOROS_CONFIG` can be used to set the path of the config file. The following example runs a docker container using a configuration file named `config.toml` located in the current folder.

Create a file `config.toml` following the [configuration](../configuration)

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.toml:/etc/boros/config.toml -p 50052:50052 ghcr.io/txpipe/boros:latest
```

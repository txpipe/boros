Boros runs two threads, where one is the pipeline to process the states of transactions, and the other one is the GRPC server to receive requests. The GRPC makes a basic validation only to check if the transactions are valid and save them as pending in the DB. Each stage in the pipeline consumes the transactions in the DB based on the status of the transaction, so if the Boros process shuts down, it can be started again without losing the state. Furthermore, the pipeline has a policy of attempts, so if there's an error, the stage is retried based on the policy.

Take a look at the [architectural decision record](./design/adrs)

## Sequence Flow

Sequence diagram to describe how Boros process the requests and the state of the transactions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box Client Side
        participant client as GRPC Client
    end

    participant grpc as GRPC
    participant ingest as Ingest Stage
    participant fanout as Fanout Stage
    participant db as SQLite
    participant dolos as Dolos

    client->>+grpc: send raw tx
    par Persist in flight
        grpc->>+db: persist tx in flight db
        db-->>-grpc: ok
        grpc-->>client: accepted
    and Process in flight txs
        par Ingest stage
            ingest->>+db: fetch next pending tx
            db-->>-ingest: next tx

            alt Tx sign enabled
                Note over ingest: need to be discussed
                ingest->>+ingest: sign tx
                opt Invalid tx sign
                    ingest-->>-grpc: grpc watcher (invalid sign)
                    grpc-->>client: event
                end
            end

            Note over ingest,dolos: UtxoRPC is used to fetch utxos to validate the tx
            ingest->>+dolos: fetch utxos
            dolos-->>-ingest: utxos
            ingest->>+ingest: validate tx
            opt Invalid tx
                ingest->>-grpc: grpc watcher (invalid tx)
                grpc-->>client: event
            end

            ingest->>+db: update tx to ready
            db-->>-ingest: ok
        and Fanout stage
            fanout->>+db: fetch next ready tx
            db-->>-fanout: next tx

            fanout->>+fanout: send tx mechanism
            fanout-->>-grpc: grpc watcher (tx submitted)
            grpc-->>-client: event
        end
    end
```

## Schema

As Boros allows one transaction just be executed after another transaction, the schema supports transaction dependencies.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    tx {
        TEXT id PK
        BLOB raw
        TEXT status
        INTEGER slot
        TEXT queue
        DATETIME created_at
        DATETIME updated_at
    }

    tx_dependence {
        TEXT dependent_id PK
        TEXT required_id PK
    }

    tx ||--o{ tx_dependence : "One tx can have N other dependencies"
```

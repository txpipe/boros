## Priority Queues

With the Priority module, Boros allows users to configure queues to prioritise transactions. Each queue has a weight that Boros uses to calculate how many slots of the quota a queue can use. For transactions where there's no queue, a default queue is set. When a queue is removed from the file and Boros still has transactions pending for the queue removed, Boros uses the default queue weight to process unknown queues.

Follow the [configuration](../configuration) to configure the priority queues.

### Example
The quota is 10, so the fanout stage has a backpressure of 10, meaning only 10 transactions can be waiting for propagation. The quota is released when transactions are sent, allowing new transactions to wait. Furthermore, two queues are configured: Queue A with a weight of 3 and Queue B with a weight of 2. Queue A has higher priority than Queue B, so Queue A receives 6 slots and Queue B receives 4 slots from the quota.

### Default
Priority configurations are not required. If not configured, the default queue is used. The default queue has a weight of 1 but can be replaced by setting a configuration with the name default. Transactions with unknown queues are processed using the default weight.
